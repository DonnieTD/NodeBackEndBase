This is my Express Rest Api Base Template 

I use this as the basis for all my API's

<<<<<<< HEAD
Features:

Supports ES6 development with bable

Async MONGODB atlas connection with only a change to .env

The simple code for this is found in lib/mongoConnect.js




=======

For now this will be Hijacked and used as a todo list:

Add csurf ( FIRST ... )

And then maybe think about making it TRUELY restfull ( AHA (Not the new paradime ...)) which to me seems to be the the most important
change we can make
