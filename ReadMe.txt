This is my Express Rest Api Base Template 

I use this as the basis for all my API's

For now this will be Hijacked and used as a todo list:

Add csurf ( FIRST ... )

And then maybe think about making it TRUELY restfull ( AHA (Not the new paradime ...)) which to me seems to be the the most important
change we can make


Down with the class component lol XD




To Be Done:

Respond with JWT so that we can share it in local storage until we figure that whole situation out

Allow cors on all I think?
Make verify a middleware 
Scan through EVERYTHING
Document properly 
Move on to the next step
