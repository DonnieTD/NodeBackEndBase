Welcome to my JS rest api base:

Here's how you get up and running.


For now this will be Hijacked and used as a todo list:

And then maybe think about making it TRUELY restfull ( AHA (Not the new paradime ...)) which to me seems to be the the most important
change we can make

Down with the class component lol XD
