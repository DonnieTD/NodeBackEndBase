Welcome to my JS rest api base:

Here's how you get up and running.

1) Open up .env
2) Add your secret key
3) Add the port you would like the api to serve on
4) Add your Database name,username, and password
5) Add the domain of the client and the api eg. localhost // hmm 
6) Start her up and she should work ( npm run start )
