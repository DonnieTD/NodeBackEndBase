This is my Express Rest Api Base Template 

I use this as the basis for all my API's

For now this will be Hijacked and used as a todo list:

Add csurf ( FIRST ... )

And then maybe think about making it TRUELY restfull ( AHA (Not the new paradime ...)) which to me seems to be the the most important
change we can make


Down with the class component lol XD
